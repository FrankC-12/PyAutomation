The Tags module in PyAutomation enables the creation, configuration, and management of tags that represent variables or data points within an automation system. This module is fundamental for the exchange of information between different components of the system, acting as the core that connects sensors, actuators, and control systems. The manual will provide detailed instructions on how to define and use Tags, including property assignment, real-time manipulation, and best practices for efficient management.
